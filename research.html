          <p>
            As our task is to create an interative video calling and privacy safe platform for 
            elderly and those in social isolation. We have conducted research 
            on existing similiar applications and what technologies
            we believe are needed for our purposes. We have had discussions 
            with the client to determine what similiar applications and 
            technologies we should investigate.

          <p>
            Houseparty is a free video social networking app that allows you
            to video chat with up to 8 friends in “rooms” and play games
            together. Its popularity has exploded during the covid-19 crisis.

              <li>
                Houseparty's icons are custom and very suggestive, but their uniqueness can be a bit confusing. We
                should therefore aim to have more commonly used SVGs for vital functionalities that the elderly do not
                get confused about.

<h2>Technology review</h2>
<h3>React</h3>
<p>
  A key part of the project is creating a good UI, for which we
  needed to choose a JavaScript framework or library. The two most
  widely used libraries/frameworks in this field are React, which is
  an open-source library, and Angular, which is a framework [3]. For
  this project, we have decided to keep using React.
</p>
<p>
  The main advantage of React is that it’s smaller than Angular and
  easier to get used to if the programmer has prior knowledge of
  JavaScript [3]. Using React will make achieving the requirements of
  the project more realistic due to its ease of use, all while
  providing the tools necessary to complete the project due to its
  compatibility with third party modules [4]. The disadvantage of having
  to import modules, however, is that our team has to make sure that
  these stay consistent throughout the code. On the other hand,
  React also has a virtual DOM (Document Object Model)
  implementation, which limits the frequency of updates to the
  actual DOM, making it faster and more suitable for a video calling
  app [3].
</p>
<p>
  Angular is a framework, so any necessary features will likely
  already be within it, and not needing to import modules would make
  using it more consistent. However, it is much larger, and
  typically written in TypeScript, a language that builds on
  JavaScript [5]. This means that it would be significantly more
  difficult to learn and would take longer to get started with.
</p>
            <p>
              React is owned by Facebook, while Angular is owned by Google, both
              of which are known for shutting down projects for various reasons,
              e.g. profitability. From a stability perspective, both are equally
              likely to lose support from their company.
              Overall, React is the more realistic option, mainly due to its
              accessibility and use of plain JavaScript over TypeScript.
            </p>
            <hr />

<h3>Next.js</h3>
<p>
  Next.js is a framework built on top of React that will empower us
  to create an even more performant and reactive application while
  reducing the complexity of the code. Some of the most important
  features of Next.js include automatic bundling using webpack,
  code-splitting, page-based routing, server-side rendering, API
  routes and scalability [7,8].
</p>

<p><b> Performance </b></p>

<p>
  Performance is one of the most important factors for our choice.
  React requires difficult techniques for optimization. Next.js
  simplifies this process.
</p>
<p>
  Automatic code-splitting is a Next.js feature that will
  improve our loading times of pages by dynamically loading JavaScript
  code that is packaged into bundles. With Next.js’s file system
  based routing we can scale our application while affecting
  the load times of our pages. When a specific route is requested by
  the client, Next.js will load that specific JavaScript bundle that
  corresponds to the requested route, thus not overloading the
  client with unused code [8, 9]. These bundles are automatically created
  by Next.js using webpack which includes optimization features by
  determining which code is shared across certain components.
  One other feature that improves the loading time of the
  application is dynamic import. Certain libraries may be needed
  only when a certain action is done by the user, therefore Next.js
  supports dynamic import which can load JavaScript code when the
  user triggers certain actions, such as the click of a button [9].
</p>
<p>
  Pre-rendering is what makes a difference when using Next.js with
  React. By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means that
  Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of having
  it all done by client-side JavaScript [7].
  Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code
  necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its
  JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive. Next.js
  has two forms of pre-rendering: <b> Static Generation </b> and
  <b> Server-side Rendering </b> [7]. The difference is in
  <b> when </b> it generates the HTML for a page: Static Generation
  generates HTML build time reusing it for each request, while the
  other generates HTML on each request [7].
</p>
<p>
  Another important aspect of this framework is the caching
  mechanism for remote fetches. Vercel, the creator of Next.js
  provides a very lightweight library, named SWR [10, 11], that improves the
  fetching mechanism in React. SWR is a strategy to first return
  the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request
  (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data [10, 11]. In the
  context of our application, SWR server a very important role in adapting the application to the Progressive Web Application (PWA)
  standard that would allow it to run "offline" (without the use of
  internet services). This enables us to create a PWA that can be
  installed added to devices' home screens even if it is a web app.
</p>
<p><b> Deployment </b></p>
<p>
  Since our base code has already been designed to function well
  with the Vercel deployment system (as recommended by Next.js on
  their website), Next.js makes a great choice [12].
  The process is very easy requiring only the repository of the
  Next.js app and the configuration data to be copied to Vercel [12].
  This will facilitate our production testing iterations by reducing
  the time taken to redeploy and reconfigure our Next.js applciation
  for production. Easy to deploy using Vercel, the creator of
  Next.js. But gives the option of deploying on every server that has Node.js, thus allowing us to fulfil our requirement of
  deploying on a remote server for users to be served the application seamlessly.[12]
</p>
<hr />
<h3>Docker</h3>
  <p>
    Docker is a platform that enables your application to be deployed,
    shipped and run on different systems and environments without
    changing the source code. This is achieved by isolating the app
    from the environment of the machine that is running on (host
    machine) [13]. Those isolated environments are called
    <b>containers</b> which can run quickly, securely and reliably
    with all the needed dependencies. Docker is the industry standard
    for container-based applications [14].
  </p>
  <p>
    Containers can be built from Docker <b>images</b> which represent
    immutable snapshots of software packages such as Ubuntu, Node.js
    and many others [14]. Thus, a container can be constructed to run
    multiple software packages from multiple images without needing to
    install them on the host machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another very important feature is the <b>Docker Compose API</b>.
    Docker Compose allows multiple containers to communicate at
    runtime, thus giving the possibility of running parts of the
    application from multiple environments. Docker inserts the
    containers in their own local network that runs on the Docker
    Host, separate from the network of the host machine. This enables
    an application to have a server container that communicates with a
    client container in a secure, isolated environment.
  </p>
  <p><b> Deployment </b></p>
  <p>
    In the context of our project, Docker is very useful in achieving
    <b>cross-platform functionality</b>. More exactly, Docker would
    allow clients to deploy the application consisting of the
    client-side, server-side and database locally on the consumer
    device without detriment to the features. Moreover, Docker
    containers are very lightweight as they share the machine’s OS
    system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application.
    This allows our application to
    <b>run on lower-end hardware</b> and devices without consuming
    resources unnecessarily.
  </p>
  <p><b> Privacy & Security </b></p>
  <p>
    Since Docker enables our application to run entirely locally, the
    communication between client-server and server-database in the
    <b>cloud is removed</b>. In addition, Docker containers are very
    secure as they operate within their own
    <b>isolated environment and network</b>. Most important security
    features include: containers have their own namespace in the
    kernel which means docker containers cannot see and interact with
    host machine processes, limted attack surface of the Docker Engine
    and restricted root access of the container processes on host
    machine [13,14].
  </p>
<hr />
              <h3>Jitsi</h3>
              <p>
                The primary use-case of our project is video calling, and as we’ve
                all realized during the covid-19 pandemic there are many platforms
                through which one can video-call someone. Many of these platforms
                - including Wire, Google Meets, Zoom, WebEx, and Facebook Portal -
                also allow you to embed their features into your own app to deploy
                and build video calling solutions. However, despite they
                opportunity to utilize these well-known platforms we have decided
                to use Jitsi Meets (an open-source (Apache) WebRTC JavaScript
                application) as the backbone for our video calling feature
                [15].
              </p>
              
              <p><b> Advantages of Jitsi </b></p>
              
              <p>
                There are numerous benefits in using Jitsi Meets contra others.
                First and foremost, it is free, open source and can run directly
                in the browser without the need to install anything else.
                [15] Furthermore, unlike most
                competitors there is no need to register an account. One can
                simply generate a meeting URL and access it directly, something
                that is important for our client. More importantly, Jitsi has
                support for End-to-End encryption and uses ephemeral video calling
                standards to that meeting rooms only exist whilst the calls take
                place and that there is no saved personal data collection.
                Something that is not the case with most competitors
                [16].
              </p>
<hr />
    <h3>MongoDB - database</h3>
    <p>
We have decided to use MongoDB to store and manage individual user profiles. MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented
NoSQL database. Unlike traditional SQL alternatives such MySQL, is does not use a relational structure with tables and
rows [17]. We find it useful that MongoDB is object based with JSON-like documents
which we believe makes it simpler for us to represent the various hierarchical relationships.

Schemas are optional, so different formatted data can be inserted. This is helpful if plugins are created for the app
that need to store data of different types.

On the other hand, we don’t have to perform any complex queries, and have no need to analyze data, something that one
might argue MySQL is better at. The simplicity of using JSON format ultimately makes MongoDB our choice.
    </p>
<hr />
    <h3>Azure DevOps</h3>
    <P>
Azure DevOps is one of many available DevOps tools for developers. It helps with the automation of the processes to
deploy a software system. Including Build -> Test > Release systems. We have decided to use Azure DevOps because it
helps shorten our overall development cycle and provides additional functionality such as Azure repos (for source of
control of our code) and numerous planning and tracking tools to detect code defects [18]. Whilst there are numerous
other similar tools, such as Jira, Azure offers three key advantages.    
</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>We have Microsoft accounts through university and Azure Devops can therefore easily be used using our school accounts.</li>
                  <li>It is fully integrated with Git.</li>
                  <li>Compared to JIRA its issue tracker is not isolated from the code base in Github.</li>
                </ol>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      To summarize, our technology choices enable us to build an application that has good performance but also could be
      deployed in an isolated environment. We aim to speed up our development cycle by using azure to help us with automated
      deployment sprint and track our commits in our sprints. We've also researched similar applications and found that many
      of them have limited privacy features not necessarily a UI designed for the elderly and other less tech-savvy in social
      isolation.
