            <h3>Project Background</h3>
            <p>
            Covid-19 has highlighted society's need to help people in social isolation, particularly amongst our most vulnerable –
            the elderly. Social Isolation over prolonged periods can have serious consequences in terms of mental and physical
            health [1,2]. Our client, IBM, has several 'FISE' (Franklin Immersive Social Engagement) projects which all are
            orientated around the development of open-source applications that help with social integration amongst the elderly and
            those in social isolation. Our group is working on of these FISE projects - 'Social Isolation Assistance with Simplified
            Calling'.
            </p>

            <h3>Project goal</h3>
            <p>
            Our project goal is the development (<b>proof of concept</b>) of an interactive, privacy-safe, video calling platform for the elderly and others
            in social isolation. This platform's accessibility and design should be simple and tailored for the elderly both at
            care-homes and residential homes. The platform should also be integrated with other FISE apps (Concierge and AskBob) to
            set the building stones for a wider integrated FISE ecosystem.

              <br> *Note that the goal of this project has changed over time per the request of our clients.
            </p>

            <h3>Requirements gathering</h3>
            <p>
              In order to understand the requirements of our clients further, we arranged a video-conferencing meeting with them.
              During the meeting, our clients gave us a list of requirements and pointed out the priority of each requirement. In
              subsequent meetings, we further clarified any ambiguities and made a MoSCoW list with all the requirements.
            </p>
            <p>Here is an example of questions that we asked during our meetings:</P>
            <ul>
              <li>What are the key platforms this will be used on?</li>
              <li>What IBM Watson services should be provided?</li>
              <li>Conservative or Modern design? Based on research or more traditional web design guidelines?</li>
              <li>What user data should be stored?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>Following our client meetings, we set up interviews with our users. Below are some of our transcripts from our primary users - elderly.</p>
            <p><b>Elderly user 1</b>
              <br><b>Q:</b> What people would you like to stay connected with through a video calling app?
              <br><b>A:</b> Primarily family and friends.
              <br><b>Q:</b> Do you usually use phone or desktop apps?
              <br><b>A:</b> No, I find them hard to operate with as they require a lot of dedication to learn.
              <br><b>Q:</b> What troubles you most about using apps?
              <br><b>A:</b> They are all different and can let you down sometimes.
              <br><b>Q:</b> What do you think about the ability to execute voice commands?
              <br><b>A:</b> Sounds great. If the computer can understand you well, might be easier than scrolling through a very large list of
              elaborate commands.
              <br><b>Q:</b> How about online board games with friends (i.e. chess)?
              <br><b>A:</b> That would be very interesting.
            ​</p>

            <p><b>Elderly user 2</b>
              <br><b>Q:</b> Would you agree to share your data with renowned institutions such as NHS?
              <br><b>A:</b> Yes, I don't mind them knowing. All I want is to be aware when this is happening.
              <br><b>Q:</b> Will you use this app for recreation?
              <br><b>A:</b> Mostly. I want to be able to have about 10 people in the meeting without much effort.
              <br><b>Q:</b> Do you have trouble reading small-sized texts?​
              <br><b>A:</b> Yes. It starts to feel exhausting after a while.​
              <br><b>Q:</b> Would you create an account to use our app?​
              <br><b>A:</b> Probably. But I would be very frustrated if I must remember and type in the credentials every time. Preferably, I should
              not need an account or my relatives would handle the account for me.
              <br><b>Q:</b> Would you use a feature that allows you to check in every day and notify your family that you're not fine?​
              <br><b>A:</b> Yes, I'm living alone due to the pandemic, so I'm sure that knowing that I'm okay would put my family at ease.​
            ​</p>

            <h3>Use case diagram</h3>  
            <p>To make the use case of our project more clear, we decided to express it using a diagram.</p>
            <div style="display: flex;">
              <div style=" flex: 33.33%;
              padding: 5px;"">

              </ul>
            </p>

          <h4> User </h4>
          <p> The admin’s role lies in managing a user’s (elderly) account. An admin’s main use cases include:
            <ul>
              <li>Sending emergency messages if they are in distress.</li>
              <li>Using voice commands to perform in-app tasks such as changing backgrounds or calling contacts, or to receive various
                information such as weather forecasts, recipes for food, etc.</li>
              <li>Using plugins to gain access to various features (which can be set by a developer), such as live news feeds or games.</li>

            </ul>
          </p>


            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <a href="images/Persona2_website.png" class="image fit"><img src="images/Persona_website.png" alt="" /></a>
            <p>Hugh Lawson (elderly person)​
            Hugh is a retired lawyer who lives far away from his family and can't visit them or his friends due to the COVID-19
            pandemic. He is also isn't very tech-savvy, so he wants to find an easy-to-use video calling app or site which would
            allow him to stay in touch with his family and friends. Hugh's grandson recommended him to use FISE's video calling app
            as it is privacy-safe and would not require him to log in with a user-name and password, but only a one-time code. He
            found it easy to start a call because the layout is simple and similar to other video calling apps/websites. He also
            found calling and inviting his friends and family into the call to be straightforward, either just pressing on their
            image or sharing a link. Hugh suffers from occasional seizures, which is why he tried out the check-in feature for a few
            days, which he found to be an incredibly useful and quick method to notify his family that he is doing fine. </p>
            <a href="images/Persona2_website.png" class="image fit"><img src="images/Persona2_website.png" alt="" /></a>
            <p>Josh is a student. His grandfather lives in a nearby care home, and Josh would usually visit him every two weeks.
            However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the care home has enforced strict preventative measures and Josh can’t visit him
            anymore. He is worried that he might become more distant to his grandfather, and that his grandfather might feel lonely
            now that there’s no one who can visit him. His grandfather isn’t very tech-savvy, so he is looking for an app which he
            could easily manage for him. </p>
