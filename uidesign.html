            <h3>Design Principles</h3>
            <p>
              The UI is an important aspect of our project, and it is 
              a key requirement for the app to be simple to use and accessible
               to the elderly. More specifically, the app could be used by people who are shielding,
                whether that is due to COVID-19 or for other reasons.
                Therefore, we have based our design on gerontological 
               studies [1] which outline guidelines when it comes to designing 
               UI tailored towards elderly people.
            </p>
            <p>
              From these studies, we have derived several principles 
              which we made sure to follow during development. Some of these include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>No need for double clicking</li>
              <li>Graphics should be relevant (not for decoration)</li>
              <li>Simple and meaningful icons</li>
              <li>No pull-down menus</li>
              <li>No deep hierarchy (don’t have too many sub-levels)</li>
              <li>Information grouped into relevant categories</li>
              <li>Simple and clear language</li>
              <li>No irrelevant information on the screen</li>
              <li>Simple, clear and consistent layout, navigation and terminology</li>
              <li>Conservative use of colours</li>
              <li>Lack of blue and green colours</li>
              <li>High contrast between foreground and background</li>
              <li>No moving text</li>
              <li>Content should not all be in colour (where colour is any colour except black and white)</li>
              <li>Simple and easy to follow error messages</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Since our app is targeted towards elderly
               users - some of which might be in care homes - it was very important
              for us to follow these points. Our target 
              users could have disabilities such as 
              Alzheimer’s, which is why a simple design 
              and lack of a deep hierarchy is necessary, 
              or, for example, they could have weak eyesight, 
              which is why we needed to avoid certain colours 
              and ensure high enough contrast. Another 
              significant point for us to consider was that the 
              elderly tend to not be very familiar with 
              technology, which is why we avoided things such 
              as pull-down menus. In general, we hoped that
                by following these guidelines our app would be more suitable 
                for our target users.
            </p>
            <p>
              These design principles mainly apply to the app and not to the 
              dashboard (a page for account administration by elderies relatives or friends), since the user (typically an elderly person), is not 
              intended to use it. The dashboard will be used by an 
              admin, who is expected to have more experience with technology, 
              and while we did our best to make it have a clear and simple UI, 
              our main focus was on making the app easy to use for the elderly.
            </p>
            <h3>Sketches</h3>
            <p>
              When designing our UI, we started off by making sketches, so that
              we could determine roughly what it should look like.
            </p>
            <div class="w3-content w3-display-container">
            <img src="images/sketches1.jpg" style="max-height: 600px" />
            <br/>
            <img src="images/sketches2.jpg" style="max-height: 185px" />
            </div>
            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <p>
              Based on these sketches, we then created a prototype 
              using FIGMA, which in turn helped us finalize our UI
               design and move on to development. Top 2 images are the app, and the bottom images are the dashboard for account administration.
            </p>
