          <h3>Testing Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            Following discussions with our clients, we decided to use a testing philosophy
            that focused on the end-users, primarily responsive design and user acceptance
            testing. With limited time and frequent updates of requirements we, together
            with the clients, took the decision not to put i.e. unit testing as a priority.
            Particularly since we are only working on a proof of concept.
          </p>

          <h3>Responsive Design Testing</h3>
          <p>
            In line with our client's requirement of “cross-platform functionality”, responsive
            design testing has been of significance to ensure that our program is usable across
            different devices and screen types. To cover this extensively, we have:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Manually deployed and tried our program on various devices and platforms </li>
            <li>Used device emulators provided by browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox) </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Some of the devices used for testing</h4>
          <ul class="alt">
            <li>iPad (iOS)</li>
            <li>iPhone (iOS)</li>
            <li>OnePlus (Android Phone)</li>
            <li>MacBook (Mac OS)</li>
            <li>Dell Laptop (Windows)</li>
            <li>Custom Desktop (Windows)</li>
            <li>HP 2 in 1 Tablet (Windows)</li>
            <li>Philips Smart TV</li>
            <li>Samsung Smart TV</li>
            <li>Intel NUC (Windows)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Despite limited access to devices due to the pandemic, we are satisified with the Responsive Design Testing
            we
            conducted. It helped us adapt our design to be suitable on multiple types of devices.
          </p>

          <h3>Performance and Web Accessibility Testing</h3>
          <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/lighthouse/Vercel.jpg" alt="" /></span>Performance testing has
            been done
            using Google’s lighthouse, an automated tool to assess performance, accessibility and
            compliance with progressive web application standards [1]. We have conducted the testing for
            each webpage in our dashboard, and for our onboarding
            and application main page. The key to achieving high scores was to do due dilligence
            on web application standards - particularly PWA for the main app - and follow them. Furthermore, to
            alleviate the process
            of manually performing these tests we added a lighthouse pipeline to our Vercel
            which we, in turn, had a separate pipeline to via our Azure DevOps repo. This meant that after each commit
            an automatic
            lighthouse test would be performed. This was something that helped us understand how each of our commits
            affected our respective
            scores.
            The following table shows the average test results
            across all webpages for both our dashboard and app. Examples of full test reports can be found in the
            appendix.</p>

          <br>
          <div class="table-wrapper">
            <table class="alt">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Page</th>
                  <th>Performance Score</th>
                  <th>Accessibility Score</th>
                  <th>Best Practices Score</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>App</td>
                  <td>98</td>
                  <td>96</td>
                  <td>99</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Dashboard</td>
                  <td>99</td>
                  <td>95</td>
                  <td>93</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <h3>Compatibility Testing</h3>
          <p>Since we have a web-app, it is important to ensure that it is proficient enough to run across many
            browsers. For this
            purpose, we ran both manual cross-browser testing and also automatic testing through BrowserStack (free
            version).
            Our results
            were similar to what we had expected, particularly since we kept note of the browser requirements of many of
            the
            functions used in our code. </p>
          <p>
            <b> Support for (tested version):</b> Chrome (89), Edge (89), Firefox (87), Safari (14), Opera (73)
            <br> <b> No support for:</b> IE (11), Opera Mini (50)
          </p>


          <h3>User Acceptance Testing</h3>
          <span class="image right"><img src="images/user-testing.jpg" alt="" /></span>
          <p>In order to gain an understanding of how user interaction would look within our system, and in order to
            identify
            potential improvements, we asked 3 testers to carry out 3 different test cases within our platform. They
            were
            sometimes provided with additional information wherever it wasn’t possible for them to test the full scope
            of a
            feature (e.g. all the different voice commands). The test cases are detailed below, and we compiled the
            feedback we
            received into a table. </p>

          <h4>Tasks</h4>
          <p><b> Test case 1 </b>
            <br>The testers were given account details for the dashboard and asked to log in. They were tasked with
            creating a new
            user, navigating to the add background page and uploading a new background for that user, and then adding a
            contact
            and
            setting a profile picture for that new contact.
          </p>

          <p><b> Test case 2 </b>
            <br>We gave the testers a one-time code so that they could log in on the app. They were then tasked with
            changing the
            background, opening and using the plugins tab, and calling a contact.
          </p>

          <p><b> Test case 3 </b>
            <br>Again, we asked the testers to log into the app. This time, they were tasked with trying out the voice
            features by
            sending an emergency message, asking for a weather forecast, and by using voice commands to call a contact.
          </p>

          <p>*In the feedback table, features are <i>italicised</i>. </p>


          <h3>Integration & Unit Tests</h3>
          <p> We have used Jest - a Javascript testing framework that can be used for React applications [2] - and
            Enzyme - a Javascript
            testing utlity that helps test React components [3] - demonstrate unit and integration testing. Per the
            request of our client
            we did not emphasize the use of these tests. However, we still found them useful in understanding the
            rendering process and
            interactions between our components. In particular, snapshot testing was useful in ensuring that our UI did
            not change unexpectedly.</p>
